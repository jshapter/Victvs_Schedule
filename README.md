# Victvs_Schedule

This Android application displays exam data in a list view or map view.

REST API data is retreived using Ktor and serialized to build exam objects.

When using the list view tab, users can filter exams by location, candidate name or date of exam.

The map view tab displays a marker for each exam which is clickable to display the exam's information.

The user interface is built with the latest version of Jetpack Compose and Google's Material 3 UI, making use of the latest editions including:
ModalNavigationDrawer

TabRow

FlowRow

FilterChip

ModalBottomSheet

The Google Maps API key has been temporarily removed until it can be stored securely. Please contact me if you require a key for demonstration.
